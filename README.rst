**Ray provides a simple, universal API for building distributed applications.**

Ray is packaged with the following libraries for accelerating machine learning workloads:

- `Tune`_: Scalable Hyperparameter Tuning
- `RLlib`_: Scalable Reinforcement Learning
- `Train`_: Distributed Deep Learning (beta)
- `Datasets`_: Distributed Data Loading and Compute

As well as libraries for taking ML and distributed apps to production:

- `Serve`_: Scalable and Programmable Serving
- `Workflows`_: Fast, Durable Application Flows (alpha)

There are also many `community integrations <https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-libraries.html>`_ with Ray, including `Dask`_, `MARS`_, `Modin`_, `Horovod`_, `Hugging Face`_, `Scikit-learn`_, and others. Check out the `full list of Ray distributed libraries here <https://docs.ray.io/en/master/ray-libraries.html>`_.
